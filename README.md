# Comparing the Performance of XGBoost and RandomForest Classifier on Cancer Type Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at comparing the performance of two popular algorithms, XGBoost and RandomForest, in classifying types of cancer using the TCGA PAN Cancer data set.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the XGBoost and RandomForest algorithms in classifying various types of cancer based on genomic data. We utilize the comprehensive TCGA PAN Cancer dataset, which includes a wide range of genomic features.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PAN-Cancer initiative. This dataset includes genomic and clinical data for over 10,000 patients covering multiple cancer types.

Due to the size and sensitivity of the dataset:
- Access to the data must comply with the usage guidelines and access controls set by TCGA.
- Data can be accessed through 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq'.
